# React Lazy Hydration

A React component for lazy hydration of components, allowing you to defer the hydration of server-side rendered components until they're needed.

## Why

[Traditional approaches](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10923#issuecomment-338715787) to lazy hydration in React 18+ can lead to components temporarily rendering as empty strings, causing layout shifts (CLS) that negatively impact user experience.

This library solves these issues by:

- Preserving the server-rendered HTML until hydration is needed
- Preventing Content Layout Shifts (CLS) during hydration
- Providing flexible triggers for when hydration should occur
- Maintaining SEO-friendly server-rendered content

## Features

- üîÑ Lazy hydration of React components
- üëÄ Intersection Observer support for viewport-based hydration
- ‚è±Ô∏è Idle callback support for background hydration
- üéØ Event-based hydration triggers
- üé® Customizable fallback content
- ‚ö° Zero dependencies

## Installation

## Usage

Basic usage:

```tsx
import { LazyHydrate } from 'react-lazy-hydration';

function App() {
  return (
    <LazyHydrate>
      <YourComponent />
    </LazyHydrate>
  );
}
```

Advanced usage with all features:

```tsx
import { LazyHydrate } from 'react-lazy-hydration';

function App() {
  return (
    <LazyHydrate
      fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}
      intersectionObserver={{ threshold: 0.5 }}
      idleCallback={{ timeout: 2000 }}
      events={['scroll', 'mousemove']}
    >
      <YourComponent />
    </LazyHydrate>
  );
}
```

## Props

| Prop                   | Type                     | Description                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `children`             | ReactNode                | The component to be lazily hydrated                |
| `fallback`             | ReactNode                | Optional fallback content to show before hydration |
| `intersectionObserver` | IntersectionObserverInit | Optional configuration for Intersection Observer   |
| `idleCallback`         | { timeout?: number }     | Optional configuration for requestIdleCallback     |
| `events`               | string[]                 | Optional array of events that trigger hydration    |

## How it works

1. During server-side rendering, the component is rendered normally
2. On the client side, the component initially renders a static version
3. Hydration is triggered based on configured conditions:
   - When the component enters the viewport (if intersectionObserver is configured)
   - When the browser is idle (if idleCallback is configured)
   - When specified events occur (if events are configured)
4. Once triggered, the component fully hydrates and becomes interactive
